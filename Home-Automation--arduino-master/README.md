# Arduino-project


Arduino is a platform for prototyping interactive objects using electronics. It
consists of both hardware and software. This is an open source development
environment and library for writing code to control the board. For programming the
microcontrollers, Arduino platform provides an integrated development environment
(IDE) based on the Processing project, which includes support for C, C++ and Java
programming languages.
This Home Automation technique is to design and implement a remotely
controlled, energy efficient Smart Home with basic features that safeguard the residents
comfort .Arduino microcontroller is a central controller that communicates with an Web
server, which is user interface. This house network brings wired Ethernet technology,
thus making it a cost efficient hybrid system. Events can be programmed to be triggered
under specific conditions, and this can have a great role in reducing the total energy
consumed by some appliances.
This smart Home also gives security, which is a matter of great concern for all of
us in this world at our home/workplace or anywhere. Normally, we face these types of
security threat to our property-

1. Threat from fire
2. Theft
3. Gas leak.

This is based on a security system which deals with the above threats.
Whenever, there is a threat to our property in any form, then, the circuit will have a
warning system consisting of sensors, which would help in warning about the threat.
This can be practically implemented on a larger scale at our homes or our workplace or
anywhere. And this would help to receive the warning as soon as any danger
approaches. And then appropriate action can be taken immediately.#
